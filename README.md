# Wealthfront: A New Fronteir in Wealth Management? 

## Overview and Origin

* Name of company

    Wealthfront

* When was the company incorporated?

The company was incorporated in 2011

* Who are the founders of the company?

The company was founded by Dan Carroll and Andy Rachleff.

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?

The idea for developing Wealthfront itself came about from both Carroll and Rachleff’s strong resentment towards the injustice that was carried out in the world of wealth management. The everyday investor had limited access to sophisticated investment management services.

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?

Funding for Wealthfront came from private investors and venture capital firms. Wealthfront secured funding from many notable venture capital firms such as Spark Capital, Index Ventures, Greylock partners and various angel investors. Funding from private investors came from notable Silicon Valley tycoons such as Barry Mcarthy, Jeff Weiner, and Satya Patel amongst many others. According to Crunchbase, Wealthfront raised roughly $204.5 million in funding over 6 rounds, with their latest funding being raised on January 4, 2018 from a series E round.


## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

The everyday investor had limited access to sophisticated investment management services. If investors could get a hold of such a service, it usually came with very expensive fees, and/or high minimum account size requirements. Rachleff and Carroll wanted to create a company that cemented its values on the grounds of convenience, web and/or software based experiences, low-priced accessibility, and transparency.

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers? What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

Wealthfront’s investment platform primarily targets the millennial generation, which constitutes roughly 90 million Americans. The user-friendly platform caters to the individual investor’s investment style by using sfotware automation to assess their risk tolerance, and then offers them the best-suited portfolio of diversified index funds. In addition, the company continuously monitors the investment practices of the investors, and implements best practices such as portfolio rebalancing, tax-loss harvesting, and dividend reinvestment. To attract millenials and compete with traditional firms, Wealthfront utilizes software based solutions to significantly lower their marginal costs, thus setting themselves apart from incumbent giants and winning over the millennial generation. In addition, Wealthfront utilizes the “freemium” business model adopted by many tech firms such as Dropbox and Google Cloud: customers are offered basic services for free, and charged clients a fee for more premium services. In addition, clients are charged a very reasonable fee of 0.25% for any excess amount of assets managed for free, which is considerably lower than the 1% or more charged by traditional managers. This helps Wealthfront create an strong competitive advantage. 


* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

Wealthfront utilizes programming tools such as JavaScript, React, Java, Amazon CloudFront, Google Cloud Platform, C++, Kotlin, D3.js, Google Analytics, Twilio SEndGrid, Cmake, G Suite, and Zendesk to develop an automated service that is efficient, reliable and low-cost. 


## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?

Within the financial industry, wealthfront operates. Wealthfront is a fully automated, low-cost,  investment services company that provides a diversified portfolio of financial planning and investment products.

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?

- The new generation of investors (Gen X and Gen Y) want a more tailored investemnt advice, access to a dynamic advisory model, user-friendly intdigital front end, democratized investement options, and more hedging towards downside risk. 

- The advent of "robo-advisors": firms leveraging client survey data into compex algorithms that produce cutomized financial plans and asset allocations. 

- Financial advisors in the past focused their investment advice on delivering superior return for their client. However, since investement advice has now largely become commodotizied, there is a strong deamand for holistic goals-based advice. 


* What are the other major companies in this domain?

Betterment

M1 Finance 

Personal Capital 

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?

Wealthfront's unique business model and strategic approach to catering towards the millenial generation has proven to be a very disruptive business strategy. Wealthfront has created a system that allows them to manage money at 1/8th of the cost of traditional investors, offer bespoke investment advice to clients by leveraging software automation, implements best practices such as portfolio rebalancing, tax-loss harvesting, and dividend reinvestment, and has ultimately created a democratized portfolio management service.


* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?

In order to analyze it's key business metrics, Wealthfront emphaiszes on the following four metrics: visitor traffic, conversion rate, funding rate, and net deposits per client. Wealthfront's visitor traffic had grown 170% from Jan 2013 to Sept 2014. Customer conversion had increased 78% during the same period, all while increasing net deposit per client and maintaing a high funding rate. As a result, Wealthfront managed to grow it's AUM (Asset Under Management) from $97 million in Jan to $1.5 billion in October in 2014. As of 2020, Wealthfront has $15.85 billion in AUM. 

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?

Compared to it's competitors, Wealthfront is thriving amongst i'ts inteded target audience: the millenial generation. Some notable differences include:

- Offering a lower minimum acount requirement than Personal Capital ($500 vs $100,000 respectively)
- Offers a very low management fee at 0.25% of AUM per year (compared to Betterment's 0.25- 0.4% and Personal Capital's 0.49%)
- Wealthfront supports 529 college savings accounts, whereas non of the other competitors do
- Wealthfront's services are fully automated (similar to M1 finance), whereas Betterment and Personal Capital utilize human assistance. 


## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

I would highly reccomend that Wealthfront tap into the payments services and remittances domain of the financial industry. Since they have a strong liking amongst millenials, Wealthfront should establish a P2P payments application that allows users to transfer funds from their existing deposit accounts. Taking influence from Venmo, wealthfront 

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

- They would most likely have to integrate APIs that are utlized by the banking infrastucture (such as Plaid) to allow the transfer of such payments. 

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
